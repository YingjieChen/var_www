I've always wanted to step up my dress game like with the shoes, pants, shirts, haircuts, etc. but I've never really accessorized my outfits. so I bought this chain hoping it would be the solution to all of my problems and it was. this chain is so nice, like no matter what outfit I put together it just fits. you can wear it wether you want to dress up or dress down. this was a really good purchase, but my mom told me that gold plated stuff or anything gold that isn't 24k will wear off and tarnish and the chain will become green. I've only had it for a week and I haven't noticed it so just keep that in mind when purchasing anything gold plated. btw I got the gold one mid length."},{"author":"Richard Roddy III","create_at":"2015-09-30","rating":"5","body":"I got it and it looks just like the images yup and some this necklace is the truth."},{"author":"Dat Tran","create_at":"2015-09-29","rating":"5","body":"Good product"},{"author":"Gerardo Giraldo","create_at":"2015-09-25","rating":"5","body":"I already got it with me thanks,"},{"author":"Bouba","create_at":"2015-09-25","rating":"5","body":"Nice necklace!"},{"author":"uis santiago","create_at":"2015-09-23","rating":"5","body":"Need look no further..."},{"author":"Robert Hernandez","create_at":"2015-09-22","rating":"5","body":"It Was Greate"},{"author":"saac","create_at":"2015-09-22","rating":"5","body":"Looks good..
