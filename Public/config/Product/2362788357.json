I was looking for something to dress up my wardrobe for a vacation to Cabo and I think that after HOURS of looking at gold plated chains this looked like the best choice. I am very happy I chose this. I know from experience that if you don't take care of plated jewelry it can turn dark and ugly real fast. But I believe that with the proper care of taking this off and gently clean it after wearing, I expect this to last me a long time. It is very well made and I love the beautiful lobster clasp. I expect to wear this many times on many vacations. Thank you U7, I will be ordering a lot more jewelry from you in the future!"},{"author":"SR","create_at":"2016-10-09","rating":"5","body":"Well made, will order from U7 again."},{"author":"linda","create_at":"2016-09-15","rating":"5","body":"Great Quality"},{"author":"nes","create_at":"2016-09-13","rating":"5","body":"I bought this set and I do not regret it, I love it, nice size chain.

This color doesn't match what my gold rings that look like a mixture of silver and gold but the set is way better looking. The color of the picture is accurate just a tad bit more yellow. The snake design is great. The weight makes it feel real and you can tell this is quality. How they can sell it for 20 bucks for the set is beyond me but it's a steal, at least to me. I am a &#34;big guy&#34; and the bracelet fit me about one finger loose but its fine. the 28 inch chain is almost too long but i wanted it to be long, i have broad shoulders. Highly recommended if you want something that has a wow factor and is wallet friendly."},{"author":"michael rice","create_at":"2016-04-18","rating":"5","body":"Its good for what it is it has 18k mark on it I like it"},{"author":"armen sahony pieter","create_at":"2016-04-12","rating":"5","body":"Good item"},{"author":"joseph rodriguez","create_at":"2016-04-11","rating":"5","body":"nice set  very well made"},{"author":"Jordan","create_at":"2016-03-31","rating":"5","body":"The product was awesome.
