[{"author":"Omar Gudino","create_at":"2016-11-03","rating":"4","body":"The neck came pretty fast and it looked cool and detailed and not cheap looking, the reason I'm not giving a five star is because I ordered a 22 inch but came in 18in. The necklace fits good and not a bad fit but I would have liked it a little longer."},{"author":"ld Dog","create_at":"2016-09-16","rating":"5","body":"This chain is an exceptionally well-crafted necklace.  It is heavy and fluid.  The plating is very well done.  The coloring (I purchased rose gold) is exactly correct.  I purchased it to wear with rose gold earrings and the pair look as though they were purchased as a set.  It arrives with a gift box in case it is a gift."},{"author":"Amazon Customer","create_at":"2016-08-16","rating":"4","body":"Well it was a hit. My husband really likes it. It looks good on him, hangs just right and it's not too thin or too thick."},{"author":"Amazon Customer","create_at":"2016-08-13","rating":"3","body":"My husband liked the foxtail link design, but didn't like the brightness of the gold - which made it look fake."},{"author":"JMD 61","create_at":"2016-07-23","rating":"1","body":"The &#34;Platinum Plated&#34; necklace was very pretty when it first arrived and my husband loved it, but we've had it exactly 6 weeks, and the necklace is now completely green, and looks horrible. The necklace seems to be very well made, but the color\/finish they put on it, does not hold up at all, and was a waste of money for us, and in the trash it went. Buyers beware !!"},{"author":"WENDELL J.","create_at":"2016-07-12","rating":"5","body":"Super nice i will order it again ."},{"author":"Amazon Customer","create_at":"2016-05-31","rating":"4","body":"Meet my every expectation"},{"author":"joseph rodriguez","create_at":"2016-04-11","rating":"5","body":"nice chain great price"},{"author":"allan","create_at":"2016-03-31","rating":"5","body":"It as wonderful I love it"},{"author":"Jay*T","create_at":"2016-03-30","rating":"5","body":"Looks very nice and does not feel cheap!

Not stiff, has a soft flex to it.  Been wearing almost every day; easy to sleep in.  Goes well with other chains.  Not too bold a design for a woman.  Wd be pretty on all skin tines."},{"author":"Kellen Seaton","create_at":"2015-11-04","rating":"1","body":"Looks nice, but I couldn't get it off using the release mechanism on the watch.

This chain is 18K gold plated necklace it doesnt look cheap but is very shiny!  I am impressed with this necklace.  It is a very nice length and can be worn with lots of different shirts.<br \/>I have nothing negative to say about this necklace.<br \/>I received this necklace at a discount for testing and reviewing purposes.  This is my honest opinion."},{"author":"edward brown","create_at":"2015-10-02","rating":"4","body":"Unique length.. Much shorter than i expected it to be.
